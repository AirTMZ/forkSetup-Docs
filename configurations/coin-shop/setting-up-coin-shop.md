# Setting up Coin Shop

This page walks you through setting up my Playtime Levels config on your server host.

### 1. Extract & Find the Folder

Extract the downloaded .zip file and locate the folder named "plugins"

### **2. Installing Dependencies**

Download [DeluxeMenus](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/deluxemenus.11734/), [Vault](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/vault.34315/), [PlaceholderAPI](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/placeholderapi.6245/), [Luckperms](https://luckperms.net/download), [PlayerPoints](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/playerpoints.80745/), [DeluxeTags](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/deluxetags.4390/), [eGlow](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/eglow-glow-cosmetic-respects-eula-mysql.63295/), [EZColors](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/1-8-8-1-19-3-ezcolors.69871/), and [UltraCosmetics](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/1-8-8-1-19-4-ultra-cosmetics-opensource-free.10905/). Copy the jar files into your plugin folder if you do not have them on the server already

### 3. Installing the config

Copy the folders from the /plugins folder in the config files into your server /plugins folder. If some folders already exist, you may need to combine them (If you already have configs for any setups other than DeluxeMenus, DeluxeTags or UltraCosmetics, I would recommend sticking with the current ones on your server as they are not essential.

### 4. Final Setup

The config is built to work with PlayerPoints (for coins). If your server uses a different plugin, you'll have to change the commands in the file (but this can be done quickly with FIND and REPLACE).

### Extra Information

Please read the [Extra Information](extra-information.md) page before asking any questions in the support server.

Please join the discord server for support if you have trouble setting up the config. The link can be found on [this](../../) page.
