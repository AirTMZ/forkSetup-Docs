# Setting up with Minehut

This page walks you through setting up the BoxPvP Setup on Minehut. If you are using a general server host, please follow the setup [here](../boxpvp-setup/setting-up-with-a-standard-host.md).

### 1. Create your Zip File

Find the server files in your downloaded files. You should be in a directory similar to the image below.

Select all the files and add them to a ZIP file. I recommend using 7Zip for this, but any zipping program should work.

### 2. Upload to your Minehut Server

Once you have a ZIP file of your server files, shut down your server from the main settings tab and make your way to the file manager tab

You then need to delete/cut all the server files out of the main directory of your server. If you want to keep these files, you must put them in another folder or download them elsewhere.

To do this, tick all the boxes to the left of the server folders, then press the trash can icon at the bottom of your screen.

Upload your newly created ZIP file to this file directory by using the upload file button. It should then be the only file on there.

Unzip the file by right-clicking it and pressing "Unzip"; it should create many files in the main directory. Once the file has been unzipped, the .zip can be deleted.

### 3. Select Server Version

Make your way back to the settings tab and under the panel named "Server Version". Select "Paper" as your Server Type and "1.19.4" as your Server Version. Press "Update" to save the changes.

### 4. TAB & Citizens Plugin

Download the Citizens plugin [here](https://ci.citizensnpcs.co/job/Citizens2/) and place it into your /plugins folder.

Download the TAB plugin [here](https://github.com/NEZNAMY/TAB/releases) and place it into your /plugins folder.

### 5. EULA

You will need to accept my Mojang EULA by going into `eula.txt` and changing `false` to `true` to start the server.

### 6. Starting the server

You can now start the server and enjoy your premade setup. (NOTE: The startup may take longer for the first time, as it needs to generate the necessary files).

### Extra Information

You will probably find that when you first log in, there are a lot of plugin updates. We recommend updating these if you can to avoid any issues further down the line.

Make sure to read the [Extra Information](../boxpvp-setup/extra-information.md) to continue with the setup and personalise it.

If you have trouble setting up the server, please join the discord server for support. The link can be found on [this](../../) page.
