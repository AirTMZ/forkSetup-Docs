## Setting up the LifestealCore Integration:

Since Update v3.0.0, integrating LifestealCore has become so much easier!

1. Upload the LifestealCore JAR file to the "/plugins" folder. You can download it from [https://polymart.org/r/2220](https://polymart.org/r/2220)
2. Delete "HealthSMP.jar" from the "/plugins" folder. This is the old Lifesteal plugin. It needs to be deleted, so the plugins don't clash.
3. OPTIONAL: Delete the "/plugins/HealthSMP" folder. The server will still function fine with the folder still here, but it is no longer needed.
4. Restart your server!

The LifestealCore config has been slightly configured, but you may want to configure it more, depending on your liking. Configure the file at "/plugins/LifestealCore/config.yml
